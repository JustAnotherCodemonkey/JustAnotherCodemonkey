I'm still leaning to use Git so when I mess somehing up, please be patient.

Hi I'm just another codemonkey. I know a few languages (+ "languages") such as Rust, C, C++, HTML, JavaScript, C#, Java, and SCLang (SuperCollider Languge),
but Rust is my favorite and the one in which I have by far the most experience, not only with the language itself but the ecosystem as well. The crates
(rust libraries) that I have experience in include Wgpu, Web-sys, Bevy, Cpal, Winit, Egui, and many more including very low level ones. I like
learning programming on a very low level of abstraction.

I am a massive hobbyist and like to do this whole coding thing in my spare time when I'm in the mood. Currently not sure I want to do this
full-time though tbh. Whether I love or loathe math depends on the subject. I love fractals.
